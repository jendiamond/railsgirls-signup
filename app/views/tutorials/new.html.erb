  <h2>Level 2 - Tutorial</h2>
  <h3><%= @user.first_name %> have passed the first level of acceptance
to become an official Rails Girl :)</h3>
<p>
The Second Level if you choose to accept
is to complete 4 tutorials that will help you
get the most out of the Rails Girls workshop.
</p>

<p>Upload them to me as you complete them.
Don't wait until they are all done.
</p>
<p>
Do the best you can. Have fun learning. <3
Even if you think you know this stuff,
I promise you will learn something new.
</p>

<p>
If this seems like too much work or too hard
let us know.
</p>

<p>
If this feels too basic for you then you should
consider coaching at Rails Girls.
There will be a coach training session.
